/*JAVA : 

Java comes under OOPS (Object oriented programming structure)
1) class = Object and methods 
2) object = Object is an instance of class (it represent the class)
3) Methods = When a function i s inside a class, it is know as method 

What is different between Method and Function ?

- A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate 
(i.e the parameters) and can  optionally return data (the return value)
- A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object

Pascal Notation = HelloWorld - class name, project names
Camel Notation = helloWorld - method, object, variable and function names

  {
    // print statement syntax
    System.out.println("Hello this is my first Java program");
