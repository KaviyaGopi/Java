/* Syntax for object creation
 
<classname> <objectname> = new <classname>();
eg : FirstLearn f = mew FirstLearn();

Classes under same package.
- When you have same package, you need not create 2 
seprate main method inside the classes. you can create the object reference for
both the classes inside main method of either of the classes and call the method

Classes under different packages 
- When you have classes under different packages, you cannot directly create the 
object reference of one class inside the other you need to import either of the 
package into other one. After doing this, you can create the object reference 

NOTE : You can only import classes or packages if they are under the same project. 
Importing from another project cannot be done
